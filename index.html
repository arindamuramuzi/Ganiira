   <h2>LOVE AT HEART </h2>
   <p> I consider her as the highest mountain. The guide of my dreams. With the feature of my expectations .She had wired my life when l saw her. She is the only guest in my dreams. For the first l heard her voice .That l had longed for .She mind begged my moods. I beg you that let me be yours .If only to kiss you and keep me Close at your chart for that warmth, Then give me your heart. When she falls sick,l suffer from Hypochondria. She is thief that stole my heart.She is the milky way of my night.Guess who she is. She is my secret admirer</p> 
   <h3>Hurting you is not the point</h3>
   <p> l know l have hurt many people And amongst them might be you. l know it hurts saying what you didn't want to hear.But l must say am sorry So tjat you can find someone else Or because l want you to find A better person than me It is not ony list to do so But i just want to tell you It also hurts me When l hurt you </p>
   <h2>SHE WALKS IN BEAUTY </h2>
   <p>She walks in beauty,like the night of cloudless climes in starry skies And all that's best of dark and bright. Thus mellowed to that tender lights which heaven to gaudy day denies One shade the more,One ray the less. Had half imparred the nameless grace which waver in every raben tress.Or softly lightens on her face; Where thoughts serenly sweet express how pure,how dear their dwelling place. And on that check and that brow.So soft ,so calm,yet eloquent. The similes that win,the tints that glow But tell of days in goodness spent. A mind at peace with all below. A heart whose love is innocent. </p>
   <h3>COME HOME,MY LOVE<p> You have arrested my heart .It throbs with elation .When lam awake As when lam asleep ,Thinking about you. Open your heart to none but me! Show me your moon face And offer me the opportunity To hear your melodious voice. Your love pervades the air Like the fragrance Of the queen of the night. Your radiant eyes Hold me captive And l stand hypnotized! Hold me tenderly in your arms .Do it in haste,lest l faint! Or my love bursts Into violent flames Which no flood will extinguish!</p> "&gt; </h3>
   <h1>COME TO WORLD OF LOVE </h1>
   <p>The sparkle in your eyes. The warmth of your skin. Your breath on my neck. That quivers within The beauty of your kiss. And that magic in your touch. It is for all these reasons and more. Why i love you so much </p>
   <h2>LAMINATED LOVE </h2>
   <p>Frozen flames pressed between each page;Suddemly,i felt each passing note.The painting on the wall began to breathe gently the same color repeated life. I was so close;I felt every vibration and there underneath the gloom,the roof let in the luminance of the moon.A memory unfolded while i held your hand repainting our years,a devoted love at the heart of everything. steam is drawn from our hands.The canvas. the beautiful canvas tied by solid green gold Flames brushed each wall as ageing you and I in perfect harmony.</p>
   <h3>TOGETHER MY LOVER </h3>
   <p>I scream not because of fear but because l need you to hear me i love you not because of who you are but because of who lam when am with you. I wish i could give you my pain for a moment not to hurt you but to let you know how much you have hurt me. I only say that i will always trust,honour and love you because you are the best ever in my life.</p>
   <h2> PLEASE TAKE NOT HER </h2>
   <p>Tranquilize of my flesh. Distort my face,double cross me.Turn to a mess,ruin my life.Break my feet,fracture all my bones.Discomfort me and take away my manhood.But i beg you please,not her!Accompany me to trail land.So that they do whatever they want While there,discuss with me the truth about her.Do you see her beauty beyond all sins ? Whisper to me why l have to leave her behind.If you want,take me but please,not her!She is that one thing in my life.That one treasure everyone holds.That red glowing part on my dark heart.That peak of treasure greater than diamond.So if you must take not.The Love of my heart.</p>
   <h3> IN PRAISE OF LOVE </h3>
   <p> Love is along suffering. Love is brind. Love is not envious. Love does not brag. Love is not conceited Love is not ill-mannered. Love is not seeking. Love is not irritable. Love takes not of injury. Love is not happy when injustice triumphs. Love is glad when truth wins out. Love is always ready to hope on one's heart. Love is always ready to be patient Everything else will pass away. But love will never end and till the whole world is over k</p> 
   <h2> FATE AND LOVE </h2>
   <p>I turned my face l met you on my race l made a trace To stay on the pace There was peace when we were together But now i can't believe the mess l see.We have turned to pieces Because of fate in destiny l know you're now weak but still say Don't give up because whenever l close my eyes l hear a sound say we can make it and we can fight and win its me and you and it's all about us </p>
   <h3>UNDERSTAND LOVE</h3>
   <p> Love is a mysterious connection between two bodies minds or hearts.Love is not possession, neither is it command. Love is happiness felt in presence of someone. True love can be felt even without pysicial communication. While in love it does not require you to buy gift or prepare surprise for someone.Simply be there for him or her.</p>
   <h2> I Regret..... </h2>
   <p>On the first day i saw her, she moved my heart closer, But i feared for my heart, I smiled away and died with my crush. The next day l saw her,She had met another guy,The guy moved her heart closer, She smiled at him as i smiled at her,Only her look made my day as l was dying. What followed after l saw her,She fell in love with the guy,His heart was moved to hers,As mine was lonely, just because l kept quiey about how l felt, I had lost her to my friend. The last time i saw her,l regretted the fact that l was quiet,Heartbroken i was, With my eyes, heavy,She left me with a helpless mass of threathing flesh.</p>
   <h2>My love </h2>
   <p> I just want to know That even when lam gone All we had between us Hasn't faded in the most The moments we had are worth to be never forgotten When tears,pain and grief come Replaced it with the joy we shared Know that all i never meant was real. And when the sun sets remember it That l always,l have to and l do love you.!</p> 
   <h2>CRUSH IDEAS TO SHOW SHE LOVE YOU</h2>
   <p> She is constantly talking about you<br> She blushes when someone says she has a crush on you.<br><br>You keep catching her stealing glances at you.<br><br> You notice that she stammers alot around you <br><br>She says she hates you,but her body language says otherwise.<br><br> She's pranced you before <br><br>She seems to rub sexuality into your eyes <br><br>She seems to be too shy to look into your eyes<br><br> Even though she insists,she hates you,she keeps bumping into you <br></p>
   <h3>LOVE </h3> 
   <p>Ever had a thought that someone out there in the world really wants to be yours or own your heart Every night,someone thinks about you before they go to sleep. Atleast fifteen people in this world love you The only reason someone would ever hate you is because they want to be just like you. There are atleast two people in this world that would die for you. You mean the world to someone. Someone that you don't even know exists,loves you. When love and skills work together,expect a master piece. It is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved.Love and compassion are necessities,not luxuries.Without them,humanity cannot survive. My soul can find no stair cases to heaven unless it be through earth's loveliness </p>
   <h2> I love u</h2>
   <p> While l never answered your calls, You called me tirelessly. <br>While l was out with friends,You gave me company. <br><br>While l couldn't reply your texts, You texted me endlessly <br><br>While l never cared, You told me l meant a world to you.<br><br> While other people judged,You understood me. <br><br>The more l ignored you,The more you loved me. <br><br>Even when you had your hands full,You always thought about me.<br><br>While others ran away from me,You fell in my chest <br><br>You won my heart,<br><br> I OWE YOU BABY<br></p> //
